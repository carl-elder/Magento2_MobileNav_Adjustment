# Magento2_MobileNav_Adjustment
Moving footer links to a new third tab in Magento 2 is easier said than done. With about 100 bits of JS needed after that to complete a theme I'm working on, I decided to create my first repository (I've worked in many, but never created one). Scratched out basic functionality for footer->mobile nav is complete. Now to optimize.
